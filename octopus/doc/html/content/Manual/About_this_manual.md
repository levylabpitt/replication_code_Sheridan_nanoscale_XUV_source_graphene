## Reading this manual

If you are new to {{< octopus >}} it is recommended that you read this manual sequentially. To read this manual you need some basic knowledge of {{< name "Density Functional Theory" >}} ({{< name "DFT" >}}) and {{< name "Time Dependent Density Functional Theory" >}} ({{< name "TDDFT" >}}), also a bit of numerical methods may be useful.

The way to tell what to do to {{< octopus >}} is through input variables, each one of these variables has its own proper documentation describing what it does and what are the possible values that it can take. All the documentation of the variables is contained in the {{< versioned-link "Variables" "Variables Reference" >}}. That information is complementary to this manual, here we will only give a brief description of the functionality of each variable and we will leave the details for the Reference Manual. If you are reading an electronic version of this manual, all references to input variables will be marked as hyperlinks. Opening that link will take you to a page with the reference documentation for that variable. 

There are some styles used in this documents: "{{< name "proper names" >}}" (like {{< name "Fortran" >}}), "{{< file "files and directories" >}}" (like {{< file "inp" >}} or {{< file "/tmp/" >}}), "{{< command "commands" >}}" (like {{< command "ls" >}}) and "{{< code "input file text" >}}" (like {{< code "a=0.5" >}}).
