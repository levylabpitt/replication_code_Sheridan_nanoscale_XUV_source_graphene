This folder contains the data, plot scripts and generated figures for HHG with monolayer graphene. The subdirectories are explained below.

Directory: data
   Contains data for parallel and perpendicular polarization of the excitation laser field. Each of these folders have the following subdirectories.

Subdirectory: 01.intact-symmetry
   Contains data when the symmetry of the monolayer graphen is intact (i.e. not broken). Thus, only the excitation laser field is applied.

Subdirectroy: 02.broken-symmetry
   Contains data when the symmetry of the monolayer graphen is broken by applied a quasi-static DC field. Thus, both the excitation laser and DC bias fields are applied.



The code used for the simulations is the Octopus code in the directory octopus/
The code is an open-source code freely available online at: https://gitlab.com/octopus-code/octopus
The proper documentation of the code can be found on the Octopus website: https://octopus-code.org/
